# Evaluation Metrics

1. **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Measures the average of the squares of the errors, giving more weight to larger errors.
2. **RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)**: The square root of MSE, providing an error metric in the same units as the target variable.
3. **RSS (Residual Sum of Squares)**: The sum of the squared differences between the observed and predicted values.
4. **SSR (Regression Sum of Squares)**: The sum of the squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the observed values.
5. **TSS (Total Sum of Squares)**: The sum of the squared differences between the observed values and the mean of the observed values.
6. **RÂ² (R-squared)**: Represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from the independent variable(s).
7. **MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error)**: The mean absolute percentage difference between the observed and predicted values, expressed as a percentage.
